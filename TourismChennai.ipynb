    "   **Chennai** also known as **Madras** is the capital of the **Indian state of Tamil Nadu**. Chennai is among the **most-visited Indian cities by foreign tourists**.

Using the FoursquareAPI & ZomatoAPI the data mentioned below is retrieved. Based on the Venue Name, Latitude & Longitude obtained from the FoursquareAPI we request for data from the ZomatoAPI. We have collected a total of **119 Venues within a 5km radius** of the geographical co-ordinates of Chennai. Since we are using two datasets each from different API, there maybe some noise. In-order to clean this data, we are eliminating venues with latitude & longitude values more than 0.0004. On cleaning this data we are left with **74 venues** to obtain a working model."
