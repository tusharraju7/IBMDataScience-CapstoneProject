    "   **Chennai** also known as **Madras** is the capital of the **Indian state of Tamil Nadu**. Chennai is among the **most-visited Indian cities by foreign tourists**. Tourism-guide publisher **Lonely Planet** named Chennai as **one of the top ten cities in the world to visit in 2015**. Chennai was ranked the **43rd-most visited city in the world** for the year 2015. The **Quality of Living Survey** rated Chennai as the **safest city in India**. Chennai attracts 45 percent of health tourists visiting India, and 30 to 40 percent of domestic health tourists. **National Geographic** mentioned Chennai as the **only South Asian city** to feature in its 2015 **\"Top 10 food cities\"** list. Chennai was also named the **ninth-best cosmopolitan city in the world** by Lonely Planet. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the **UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list for its rich musical tradition**.With all this tourist attraction taken into account, a system that can find a place suitable for the tourist to vist during their stay will be helpful. Our goal is to **identify places based on their rating & pricing** and make it visible to the tourists in-order for them **to choose a place to visit based on their budget and based on the venue's rating**.\n",
